\usage{
task11_dt(
  variants_file = "variants.csv",
  genes_file = "gene_annotation.bed.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variants_file}{Path to CSV file of variants (columns: chr, pos, sample_id, impact)}

\item{genes_file}{Path to CSV file of gene annotation (columns: chr, start, end, gene)}
}
\value{
list(overlaps_dt11, counts_per_gene_dt, genes_high_all_dt)
}
\description{
This function maps SNP variants to genes using genomic interval overlap:
it converts variant positions to 1-bp ranges, identifies overlaps with gene
coordinates, counts HIGH-impact variants per gene and sample, and lists genes
containing HIGH-impact variants across all samples.
