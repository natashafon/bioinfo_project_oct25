\usage{
task10_dt(
  peaks_file = "atac_peaks.bed.csv",
  genes_file = "gene_annotation.bed.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_file}{Path to CSV file of ATAC-seq peaks (columns: chr, start, end, score, etc.)}

\item{genes_file}{Path to CSV file of gene annotation (columns: chr, gene_start, gene_end, gene)}
}
\value{
list(overlaps_dt10, peaks_per_gene_dt10, top20_dt10)
}
\description{
This function maps ATAC-seq peaks to gene bodies using \code{data.table}:
it sets keys on genomic coordinates, performs an interval overlap join
between peaks and genes, computes overlap length in base pairs,
counts peaks per gene, and returns the top 20 genes ranked by total
overlapped base pairs.
