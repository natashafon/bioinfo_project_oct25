\usage{
task11_df(
  variants_file = "variants.csv",
  genes_file = "gene_annotation.bed.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variants_file}{Path to CSV file of variants (columns: chr, pos, sample_id, impact)}

\item{genes_file}{Path to CSV file of gene annotation (columns: chr, start, end, gene)}
}
\value{
list(overlaps_df11, counts_per_gene_df, genes_high_all_df)
}
\description{
This function maps SNPs to genes using base R:
it compares variant positions against gene coordinates, counts HIGH-impact
variants per gene and sample, and reports genes that show HIGH-impact
variants in every sample.
}
