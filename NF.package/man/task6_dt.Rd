\usage{
task6_dt(
  labs_file = "clinical_labs.csv",
  vitals_file = "vitals_time_series.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{labs_file}{Path to CSV with columns: patient_id, time_iso, lab, value}

\item{vitals_file}{Path to CSV with columns: patient_id, time_iso, vital (HR/SBP), value}
}
\value{
list(merged_dt6, corr_summary_dt6)
}
\description{
This function performs nearest-time matching of vitals to lab draws:
for each lab record, it finds the closest heart rate (HR) and systolic
blood pressure (SBP) measurement in time for the same patient using
a rolling join, computes the time lag in minutes, and summarizes the
correlation between CRP and HR/SBP by patient.
