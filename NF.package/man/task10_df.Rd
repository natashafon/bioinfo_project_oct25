\usage{
task10_df(
  peaks_file = "atac_peaks.bed.csv",
  genes_file = "gene_annotation.bed.csv"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_file}{Path to CSV file of ATAC-seq peaks (columns: chr, start, end, score, etc.)}

\item{genes_file}{Path to CSV file of gene annotation (columns: chr, gene_start, gene_end, gene)}
}
\value{
list(overlaps_df10, peaks_per_gene_df10, top20_df10)
}
\description{
This function maps ATAC-seq peaks to genes using base R operations:
it compares genomic intervals per chromosome, calculates overlap
length in base pairs, counts overlapping peaks per gene, and returns
the top 20 genes with the highest total overlap.
